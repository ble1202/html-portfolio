<h1>The Best Animes According to Britney</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3> Attack On Titan </h3>
<p>This has been my favorite anime I've watched so far, the storyline and action is unbeatable. 
    The ending was crazy, I can't believe some people have been watching this show for over 10 years.</p>
 
<h3>Promise Neverland</h3>
<p> Craziest storyline I've watched, loved every mintue of it. Binged it in two days.</p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p> I like this dark anime, interesting watch. </p>
